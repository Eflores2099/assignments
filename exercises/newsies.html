        <h1>Ex-hippie says bomb he left outside Nederland's police station was a statement against police killings, not a terror act</h1>

            <p>Invoking the 1970 Kent State shooting and the 1971 police shooting of his friend Guy Goughner, ex-hippie David Ansberry claims the bomb he left in front of the Nederland police station was nothing more than a political statement, not a terror attack.

                    In the first explanation of why he planted a bomb on Oct. 11, 2016, Ansberry wrote a four-page letter directly to federal Judge Christine Arguello in anticipation of his sentencing Friday morning in U.S. District Court in Denver.
                    
                    Prosecutors have argued that the 67-year-old created a device containing highly volatile and dangerous explosive chemicals that could easily have gone off and killed innocent bystanders in a strip mall in the Boulder County mountain town. Prosecutors are asking Arguello to sentence Ansberry to 27 years in prison.
                    
                    “There was no evidence presented at sentencing that Ansberry intended to create a hoax device or a device solely intended to frighten passersby,” federal prosecutors wrote in a recent sentencing motion.
                    
                    Ansberry pleaded guilty in July to a charge of attempting to ignite a weapon of mass destruction. In late October and early November, he underwent a two-day sentencing hearing in U.S. District Court that ended with Arguello asking both sides to file briefs on the issue of whether Ansberry committed a terrorist act.
                    
                    "The act I have taken responsibility for was intended to bring to the public's attention the continuing tragedy of the murders of unarmed civilians by a few in law enforcement," Ansberry wrote in his letter. "I did not seek to terrorize or cause the public pain as it would be counterproductive to my goal."

                  <div class = "column">   
                    <p>In his letter, he acknowledged that he had a personal stake in one of the fatal police shootings he claimed have continued to recent years, as illustrated in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
                    
                    "When I was 19, in 1971, a town marshal who elected himself judge, jury and executioner summarily executed Guy Gaughner, also 19, and who I considered my brother. Guy died alone in the dark woods outside of Nederland, Colorado, with a bullet to his head," Ansberry wrote. "Those who aided and abetted Guy's executioner, some who still walk the streets of Boulder County, shielded his executioner for 30 years. He died never having served a day in jail."
                    
                    Data contradicts a widely held public perception that police shootings of unarmed people are rare and that the deceased deserved it, he wrote.
                    
                    Prosecutors claim that the crime Ansberry pleaded guilty to is specifically a “federal crime of terrorism,” prosecutors David Tonini, Greg Holloway and Jennifer Levy wrote in their brief.
                    
                    Early on the morning of Oct. 11, 2016, Ansberry left a backpack containing an improvised explosive device outside the then-empty Nederland police station, which sits in a strip mall. Nederland police officer Darragh O'Nuallain later brought the bag into the station, where it sat for 40 minutes before he opened it and realized it contained a bomb.
                    
                    An STP oil sticker with the phrase “RIP Deputy Dawg Murdered by Marshal 7/17/71” was found near the Nederland police station the day of the attempted bombing. Ansberry had belonged to a hippie group called the STP Family in the early 1970s.
                    
                    “The evidence presented at the sentencing hearing (last fall) demonstrated that Ansberry created an improvised explosive device (IED), deciding to use HMTD, an extremely volatile and unstable high explosive,” the prosecutors wrote in their brief.
                    
                    Ansberry, who stands 3-foot-6 and goes by the aliases Jessie Howard and Midget Jessie, had tried 11 times to detonate the bomb with a cellular phone, authorities have said.</p>
